\chapter*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

This is a bachelor thesis written by three computer science students and one information systems student at Østfold University College during spring of 2019.
The basis for the project is the lack of a central repository providing an overview of the items at Østfold University MakerSpace.
The project aims to provide MakerSpace with said repository in addition to providing students and employees alike with the necessary tools required to search the repository effectively and efficiently.

The group would like to thank Terje Samuelsen for the invaluable guidance and insight he has provided the group.
In addition the group would like to thank Michael Anderesen Lundsveen for providing us with the project as well guiding the group with his technical expertise.
The group would also like to thank Ted Magnus Sørlie for aiding the group with server assistance when needed.
Lastly the group would like to thank the participants of the questionnaire whose insight proved valuable in shaping the project.

\chapter*{Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Summary}
With this project the group has been researching how to develop a management system and the possibilities for a lending system for HiØ MakerSpace. Since HiØ MakerSpace don't have a digital system the group has tried to make management system with a lending module. By gathering information about other Makerspaces and evaluating web site with a similar setup MMS could have. It has made it easy to make wireframes and also collecting good idea's for development. 

The methods and technologies used to achieve the product and why it was done through gathering data and analyzing different technologies is documented with why the group ended with the technologies used. For the methods used for gathering data and managing the project and why the methods was chosen with the benefits it will have for the project.  

The implementation of the technologies, how it was done and how  it works from frontend to backend with a single page application and how it is connected. 
Results from evaluation and testing and MakerSpace interview and questionnaire. What was achieved by testing and gathering information. Discussion of how the project went, what difficulties the group had, what was done and how well it went. Ending with the conclusion of the project talking about what has been achieved and how the continuation of the project will be.


% The group have shared work where some had responsibility for the frontend developing and some for the backend. Some of the frontend technology works and it has been made a solid backend for this project. The prototype that was made has also conducted a usability test, where good feedback was receiving. With all the feedback that has been gathering, it has been collected some information and good idea's for further developing of the system that the group have been working at.

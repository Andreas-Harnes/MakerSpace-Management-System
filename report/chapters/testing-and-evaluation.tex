\chapter{Evaluating and testing}
Explains how the components of the application were tested - which components were tested, how were they tested and who tested them.
The chapter also provides the feedback received and whether the application passed the acceptance tests.

\section{Heuristic evaluation}
The purposes with this heuristic evaluation is that the group is gonna look at a another website that share some of the similarity as the group think the system in developing will have. For this evaluating the group alongside with the assignment provider has decided that they are gonna look into finn.no website. The test itself will be performed by one of the group members and by the assignment provider.

Finn is an website where users can exchange and sell stuff that they have at home. The group think that by looking at finn, it will give some idea to how they do they're inventory, categorizes things and what kind off layout they have on they're website. Finn have also been nominated for best interaction design,
and considered to have good universal design.\cite{finn_nominert} %kilde
That makes it a good choices for the group to look into, since universal design is also something the group need to implement in the developing av the system. 

When doing a heuristic evaluating, it needs to be sets some heuristics. That is some kind off rules that will be followed through the evaluating. They should contain what things that will be look for when doing the evaluating. The heuristics that have been agreed with is:
